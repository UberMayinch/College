Here are the resources I used for this course:

1. Good Tutorial on VMD- https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/vmd/tutorial-html/vmd-tutorial-main.html
2. Good Tutorial on NAMD- https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/2.9/ug/ug.html

You won't be able to learn everything that's relevant so it's better to concentrate on getting functional knowledge of the software i.e. being able to do the specific things that they ask you to do. Additionally, you should explore a bit in the different menus that you're using (because they might ask stuff related to that in exams) and also read up wikipedia articles relating to that to get a basic idea of QM.
