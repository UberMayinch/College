This will be about as rigorous as math will get at IIIT, so you should explore a bit and see how you feel about pure math. 

**Aside:** If you want to get really good at math and develop very strong intution, I would recommend starting reading this in Sem-1 and continue over the next few semesters -https://web.evanchen.cc/napkin.html

Books referred (H2):
1. Mathematical Methods for Physicists Arfken and Weber
2. Erwin Kreyzsig

Honestly, this is kinda just like JEE math, you can grind and get pretty good at this even without developing any intution. 
I would recommend getting a good intution about vector calculus and complex analysis during this part tho. 
1. Highly recommended video series for complex analysis - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoTaJE16uLk&list=PLDcSwjT2BF_UDdkQ3KQjX5SRQ2DLLwv0R
2. Watch Khan Academy videos on vector calculus; They were recorded by Grant Sanderson (3b1b), so they're really good. Seriously.
